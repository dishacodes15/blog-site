        Hi there! I'm Disha, a second year UG student. Ever since I started my degree, (even before that, if we're being honest), I've always loved to create things, and yap. Growing up with a software engineer for a dad, i've been exposed to tech pretty much my entire life, so choosing CS as a degree felt like a no brainer to me. It got even more exciting when i could basically create anything with the knowledge of a few languages. what better way to combine my love for yapping and creating by making a blog website?
      </p>
      <p>
        Glitches is my digital playground where I hopefully explore and delve into my current interests, whether they be book reviews, what I learnt recently about tech, or my trials and failures as I code and try to make myself job-ready in this highly competitive world of tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can usually find me reading books/manga, watching anime, or straight up sleeping. A girl's gotta get her beauty sleep, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you enjoy reading my long-winded tangents as much as I enjoy writing them. Let's connect!
      </p>
